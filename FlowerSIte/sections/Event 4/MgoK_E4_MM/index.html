			<h2>Introduction</h2><br/>
			<p>
				Grand Theft Auto (usually abbreviated GTA) is a series of games that incorporate driving and action gameplay styles. Created by the British developer Rockstar North, GTA games are set in vast, predominantly urban "sandbox" environments, and feature protagonists involved in organized crime. The distinguishing feature of the games is the possibility to hijack and drive most vehicles encountered in the game world. With the exception of the expansion packs to the first Grand Theft Auto, which are set in London in the 1960's, all GTA games are set in the USA, in fictional cities modeled after real-world locations such as New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and others.<br/>
				<br/>
				The first Grand Theft Auto (1997) and its sequel were done with top-down 2D graphics, and put the player into the role of a criminal performing tasks for various organized crime lords and advancing in their ranks. Subsequent games also followed this structure, but notable enhancements were made to story-related content. The two initial games were nearly devoid of narrative and lacked characters with distinct personalities. This has changed with the advent of Grand Theft Auto III (2001), the series' first fully 3D installment, which introduced storyline and characterization, and also set the gameplay template used in subsequent releases. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) further emphasized narrative, increasing the series' tendency towards satire, social and political critique, parody, and black humor. Later releases became more focused on morally ambiguous heroes (compared to the entirely ruthless protagonists of earlier installments), adding personal and dramatic elements to the storytelling.

					<h2>The Brotherhood of Jah Army of Love</h2>
					<br/><br/>
					The Brotherhood of Jah Army of Love, also known as the Rastas, is a gang in Grand Theft Auto that is based in Vice City. The gang is at war with the Babylon gang and corrupt VCPD police officer Samuel Deever. The leader of the gang is Brother Marcus. The gang controls the drugs trade in Vice City and is known to use extreme violence, including Brother Leroy acting as a suicide bomber during one mission.
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt1_2">
					<h2>CARTWRIGHT</h2>
					<br/>
					The Cartwright Gang is ran from since an unknown while to 1969 by Harold Cartwright, until he is killed by the protagonist, a former ally, on the orders of Archie and Albert Crisp. They are already in action in 1961, so it's likely that they started in the 50's. As it turns out later, Harold did not steal the drugs, making the deaths of him, his sister and Phil's all for naught. Albert summed it up by saying that Harold "was a useless prat anyway". The Cartwright Gang most likely dissolved as most of the members were killed.
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt1_3">
					<h2>SONETTI GANG</h2>
					<br/>
					Sonetti's Gang is a gang that appears in Grand Theft Auto in Liberty City. It is run by Sonetti, a man who the game's protagonist works against. Their main rivals are the Vercotti Gang.

					<h2>UNCLE FU’S GANG</h2>
					<br/>
					Uncle Fu's Gang is a gang that appears in Grand Theft Auto in San Andreas and is led by Uncle Fu. Their main rivals are El Burro and his gang.

					Uncle Fu is a main character in Grand Theft Auto and is the leader of his own Triad gang. Legend has it that Uncle Fu is over 130 years old, though there are no birth records to prove it. Uncle Fu's past offenses are piracy, illegal opium trading, lighting firecrackers on a Tuesday, witchcraft, stealing fire from the gods, torture, looting, responsible for the fall of the Tang dynasty, extortion, fencing stolen water chestnuts, inventing bronze, aiding and abetting criminals.

				<h2>HARE KRISHNA</h2>
				<br/>
				Hare Krishna is a gang that's name derives from Hinduism. They are featured as pedestrians in the original Grand Theft Auto and then become a gang that Claude Speed can take missions from in Grand Theft Auto 2. The gang is lead by  
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt2_2">
				<h2>Yakuza</h2>
				<br/>
				The Yakuza are a Japanese crime syndicate that appears in Grand Theft Auto 2. They are led by Johnny Zoo and their territory is located in the Downtown District. Protagonist Claude Speed has the option to work for Zoo and the Yakuza during his stay in the Downtown District. The Yakuza are involved in a violent war against The Zaibatsu Corporation and the Loonies.
				Their favorite radio station is Funami FM and they drive Miara sports cars. 
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt2_3">
				<h2>Russia Mafia</h2>
				<br/>
				The Russian Mafia is one of the several gangs located in Anywhere City, circa 2013. It is one of the three gangs fighting for control of the Industrial District of the city, becoming enemies with the Zaibatsu Corporation and the Hare Krishna. The Russians are led by a man named Jerkov, an ex-soldier for the Red Army.
				<br/>
				Members of the Russian Mafia are well armed, using submachine guns and driving the heavily armored Bulwark vehicle. Despite that, they are the weakest gang in the Industrial District (except the Mad Island Gang), due to them not using any explosive weapons, as opposed to the Krishnas and the Zaibatsus. They listen to KGBH as their favorite radio station. 
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt2_4">
				<h2>Rednecks</h2>
				<br/>
				The Rednecks are a gang in Grand Theft Auto 2 that are opposed to the Scientists due to their low literacy skills. Billy Bob Bean offers missions to Claude Speed that involve high levels of destruction, and doing missions for them can lower the player's faction with the Scientists. The gang operates a car crusher in the Mobile RV Park, which unlike the others found in the game, does not give the player a reward.
				The gang's logo appears to be a version of the "Dixie" flag.
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt2_5">
				<h2>Loonies</h2>
				<br/>
				the Loonies live in the mental hospital in Sunnyside which is located in the Downtown District, Anywhere City and their leader, Elmo.
				<br/>
				The neighborhoods of Fruitbat and Sunnyside are under Loonie control, while many of their missions take place at the University. They seem to be the weakest gang of the Downtown District, and the second weakest in the whole game, with the Yutes being the weakest.
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt2_6">
				<h2>Zaibatsu</h2>
				<br/>
				...
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt2_7">
				<h2>SRC Scientist</h2>
				<br/>
				<i>"The SRS represent a fringe faction of elite and disgruntled scientists, dedicated to imposing their own, dubious morality on the world. They'll fight anyone who doesn't believe in the ability of eugenics, genetic modification and euthanasia to build a better tomorrow."</i>  - GTA 2 instruction manual.
				<br/><br/>
				Sex and Reproductive Systems (SRS), referred to informally as the Scientists, are a crime syndicate in Grand Theft Auto 2 that are opposed to the Rednecks due to their high intellect. Like the rival Zaibatsu Corporation, they also operate as a publicly advertised pharmaceutical business. The Scientists are usually seen driving Meteors, and operate from the Residential District.

					<h2>COLOMBIAN CARTEL</h2>
					The exact origins of the Colombian Cartel in Liberty City aren't precisely explained, but their heavy presence in the region can possibly be explained by real-life events occurring in Colombia during the time period. The Colombian Drug War came to a head with the assassination of Pablo Escobar in 1993. By the late 1990s to early 2000s, the cartel system in Colombia was in a state of collapse. Colombian crime organizations began operating outside of Colombia, setting up operations in other Latin American countries, the United States, Canada, and Europe. It can be assumed that the Colombian Cartel in-game began moving operations to Liberty City sometime between 1993 and 1997 due to internal pressure in their home country, as they are well established in city by 1998.
					<br/><br/>
					Cartel members wear Hawaiian shirts, combat pants, Mexican hats and boots in GTA III. In GTA Liberty City Stories, the same members wear red or blue shirts with brown vests, pairs of pants and jewelry. Their favorite radio stations are Flashback FM in GTA III and Rise FM in both games.
				</div>
				
				<div class="cont_gt3_2">
					<h2>Forelli crime family</h2>
					<br/>
					The Colombian Cartel is exceptionally well armed, and are led by Catalina and Miguel to produce and supply the drug SPANK in Liberty City. It is suggested by Liberty City police records that the Colombian Cartel may be using the local airport and a harbor freight as a front to smuggle the SPANK drug into Liberty City, although they have yet to thoroughly prove this.
					<br/><br/>
					Cartel members wear Hawaiian shirts, combat pants, Mexican hats and boots in GTA III. In GTA Liberty City Stories, the same members wear red or blue shirts with brown vests, pairs of pants and jewelry. Their favorite radio stations are Flashback FM in GTA III and Rise FM in both games
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt3_3">
					<h2>Leone Crime Family</h2>
					<br/>
					The Leone Crime Family is an Italian-American Mafia criminal organization, originating from Sicily (referred to by Salvatore Leone as "the old country") whose main base of operations is in Liberty City.
					The official gang car of the Leone family is the Mafia Sentinel, a modified jet black version of the Sentinel.
					Their favorite radio station is Double Clef FM. This radio station is also favored by the city's other Mafia families (and the Leones' biggest enemies), the Forellis and the Sindaccos. In GTA III, they might sometimes listen to Flashback FM.<br/>
					The Mafia are very dangerous once hostile, capable of making quick work of vehicles if the player drives within range of their shotguns.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt3_4">
					<h2>Sindaco</h2>
					<br/>
					"Sindacco" is most likely a misspelling or a variation on the word "sindaco", which is Italian for "mayor".
					Their favorite radio station is Double Clef FM.. Sindacco members wear black shirts, black pants and brown jackets with/without sunglasses and carry pistols. In Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the mobsters dress in either brown leather jackets with grey pants and light blue shirts with chains, or in black jogging suits.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt3_5">
					<h2>Silican Mafia</h2>
					<br/>
					In 1998, under the leadership of Salvatore Leone's unnamed elderly uncle, the Sicilians sparked several wars between rival families in Liberty City in the hope of controlling the city once the previous families had destroyed each other.<br/>
					Their gang car appears to be silver/white Stingers and they dress in blue classic mobster outfits. They are a very powerful organization, with many members. The Sicilian Mafia members cannot be found on streets outside the missions.

					<h2>Cholos</h2>
					<br/>
					<i>"Bunch of Mexican-gang bangers. Bad boys trying to take over all the gun running in town." - Phil Cassidy.</i>
					<br/><br/>
					They are based in the Little Haiti and areas in Little Havana in Vice City. The leader is unknown and they are involved in a turf war with the Cubans/Los Cabrones, Trailer Park Mafia, The Bikers and arms dealer Phil Cassidy. The Cholos wear gray headbands, white tank tops, chino trousers and dickies pants.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt4_2">
					<h2>Cubans</h2>
					<br/>
					The Cubans, also known as Los Cabrones, are a Latin street gang. They are led by Umberto Robina and are based in the Little Havana district of Vice City. Cubans are considered the prominent gang in the southern end of the mainland, considering that they defeated both Cholos and the Haitians.
					<br/><br/>
					Cuban gang members are either seen wearing white sleeveless shirts with a Japanese symbol and writing, red bandanas and jeans, or a fedora hat, light yellow shirts and black pants in Vice City. By 1984 their outfits were more simple, usually wearing polo shirts or short sleeved shirts, slacks and moustache or stubble. They are armed with 9mm pistols.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt4_3">
					<h2>Haitains</h2>
					<br/>
					The gang is exclusively comprised of Haitian immigrants/descendants, and are mainly active in the Vice City Mainland, with their home turf being Little Haiti. Prior to the mission Trojan Voodoo, they will also spawn in Little Havana, often engaging the rival Cubans in gun fights which leave casualties on both sides.
					<br/><br/>
					The Haitians are primarily involved in minor street crime, such as robbery, gun crime, and petty theft, but seem to have larger ambitions, as they appear to be engaging in both arms and narcotics trafficking. By 1986, the Haitians are operating a drugs factory out of the ghettos of Little Haiti. The gang is unique in their practice of a corrupted form of Vodou, where it is implied they curse their enemies, as well as speaking in Haitian Creole, French, and English in heavy Haitian accents.
					Haitian gang members are seen wearing either blue shirts (reading RELAX), white pants and baseball caps, silver sunglasses, or light purple sleeveless shirts, jeans and blue bandanas.
					Their favorite radio stations are Flash FM and Fever 105.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt4_4">
					<h2>Mandez Cartel</h2>
					<br/>
					The Mendez Cartel was a very powerful drug cartel operating out of Vice City in the early 80's, until 1984.<br/>
					The Mendez Cartel members are depicted as wearing suits, with light colored shirts underneath, as well as having a notable moustache or ponytails. It's possible that it was the most powerful criminal organization at the time, but when their leaders were killed, the Diaz cartel quickly seized most of the drug trade in the city.The Cartel members cannot found on street outside the missions.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt4_5">
					<h2>Sharks</h2>
					<br/>
					The Sharks, also known as Streetwannabes, are a band of thugs. In GTA Vice City, they can be found around the North Point Mall and Prawn Island, but are not a threat to any other gang in Vice City. They can also be seen driving their Gang Burrito (the vehicle of the second generation of the Gang). It is suggested that they are involved in arms smuggling and drug trafficking. They seem to be on bad terms with The Bikers. They even stole Mitch Baker's prized motorcycle and stored it in a garage in Downtown Vice City. The unnamed leader of the Gang betrays Ricardo Diaz and steals his shipment of drugs, causing Diaz to order Tommy Vercetti to kill him and many others in an airstrike. They are usually seen wearing denim jackets and jeans.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt4_6">
					<h2>Vercetti Gang</h2>
					<br/>
					The Vercetti Gang or Vercetti crime family is a powerful criminal organization based in and around Vice City. The organization is known to be involved in various illegal enterprises, including extortion, drug dealing, counterfeit and pornography. They are very territorial, and hostile towards the other gangs in the city, even the Cubans and Vice City Bikers, who are on friendly terms with Tommy Vercetti.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt4_7">
					<h2>Trailer Park Mafia</h2>
					<br/>
					The Vercetti Gang or Vercetti crime family is a powerful criminal organization based in and around Vice City. The organization is known to be involved in various illegal enterprises, including extortion, drug dealing, counterfeit and pornography. They are very territorial, and hostile towards the other gangs in the city, even the Cubans and Vice City Bikers, who are on friendly terms with Tommy Vercetti.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt4_8">
					<h2>Vice City Bikers</h2>
					<br/>
					Simply put, they are "the biggest family of misfits, outcasts and badasses" as quoted by their leader, "Big" Mitch Baker. A group of stereotypical bikers, they wear leather, give off a gruff, tough persona, have long beards and hair, wear biker attire and ride chopper style motorcycles.<br/>
					Their favorite radio stations are V-Rock and Vice City For Lovers.

					<h2>Ballas</h2>
					<br/>
					They still maintain their traditional rivalry with the Families. They usually do not attack if the player happens to walk through or pass through their territory. However, if taunted enough times, or if one fires a gun in their territory, or just because of walking near and staring the Ballas will become hostile and begin to shoot or punch the player. Their dogs will also occasionally attack the player, especially if the player is Franklin. The Ballas are supporters of the Los Santos Panic Basketball Team and the Boars Baseball Club, with their purple attire matching the teams' colors.
					<br/><br/>
					They can often be seen drinking, driving cars, bikes, and even walking dogs. Most Ballas stand on the sidewalks in groups of 3-5. Their weapons include pistols and knives. Members are also seen smoking cigarettes, marijuana, and drinking.
					They're brash and love to show off their weaponry, money and guns in social media.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt5_2">
					<h2>Grove Street Family</h2>
					<br/>
					The GSF are depicted as more honorable than their rival gangs. Coming from a background of older traditions, they are against hard drugs being sold on their turf as opposed to the Ballas and Vagos. They are well known, however, for committing numerous other crimes and violent acts including gun running/arms-trafficking, gang-banging, gang warfare, murder, robbery, burglary/theft, gang-related homicide, vandalism and street violence.<br/>
					They are the sworn enemy of the Ballas, an intense and ongoing rivalry as part of the Ballas-Grove Street War. The Families also maintain rivalries with the two Mexican gangs in Los Santos - the Los Santos Vagos and the Varrios Los Aztecas. Their rivalry with the Varrios Los Aztecas is not nearly as intense as it is with the Ballas and Vagos.
					<br/><br/>
					Most of their territory can be found in the poorer/run-down neighborhoods in the far east of the city, though they also have small pockets of territory elsewhere - including the rich area of Temple and the popular tourist destination of Santa Maria Beach. They are easily identifiable by their green gang color.
					<br/><br/>
					GSF members drive the Greenwood, Voodoo and Savanna. Their favourite radio station is the Radio Los Santos. They also have three different skins that will walk and drive around their territories.
					They can occasionally be seen smoking marijuana and drinking malt liquor while talking and hanging around in groups. Green clothing is a dead give-away and members will often flash their gang handsigns. Upon spotting a Balla, Vago, or Azteca gang member, they will often engage in a violent confrontation (especially Ballas). 
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt5_3">
					<h2>Loco Syndicate</h2>
					<br/>
					While better classified as a joint business venture between several criminals, the Loco Syndicate was a collective outfit dealing with drugs, primarily cocaine. The Syndicate had its main operations based in San Fierro, and was made up of San Fierro's most powerful pimp Jizzy B, gang leader T-Bone Mendez, and the mysterious businessman (later revealed to be an undercover government agent) Mike Toreno.<br/>
					As shown in the game, Mike Toreno is the Syndicate's brains and leader, calling the shots, making decisions, thinking business through and holds connections to Latin and South American drug organizations. T-Bone is the muscle, he makes sure that Mike's orders, errands and deals are carried through perfectly, and utilizes his gang, the San Fierro Rifa for protection. Finally, Jizzy is the group's face and charisma, recruiting men to pull hits, errands and other business for the Syndicate
					<br/><br/>
					Due to T-Bone Mendez, the Loco Syndicate has strong ties with the local Mexican street gang; the San Fierro Rifa. The Loco Syndicate often employ Rifa members for protection and to do small-time dirty jobs such as selling any remaining drugs on the streets.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt5_4">
					<h2>Los Santos Vagos</h2>
					<br/>
					The Los Santos Vagos are the largest and most powerful Mexican/Latino street gang based in Los Santos and the 2nd most powerful overall gang at the beginning of the events in San Andreas. They are predominant within the poorer and more run-down neighborhoods in the far east and northeast of the city.
					<br/><br/>
					The Vagos are known to be extremely violent and will often attack in very large groups from numerous directions in an attempt to swarm and flank their enemies as part of their strategy. Most of their territory consists of close-quarter areas with numerous alleyways and shortcuts which aids them to do this. The Vagos are involved in gang-banging, street violence, murder, gang-related homicide, gang warfare, drug trafficking/manufacturing (especially the crack cocaine trade) and vandalism.
					<br/><br/>
					The Vagos appear to be the least armed gang in Los Santos, evidenced by the fact that members only carry the pistol. However, at the same time - they are one of the largest - and they use their size to their advantage. This contrasts to their primary enemy - the Varrios Los Aztecas, which function in the complete opposite way - they are the smallest but the most heavily armed. This puts the Aztecas and Vagos on equal footing in terms of power. However, the Vagos are equipped with better firepower during some missions and gang wars.
					<br/><br/>
					Members are often seen drinking beer and smoking marijuana while hanging in groups. They are easily identifiable by their  yellow bandanas in addition to 90's "cholo" style clothing. Vagos will also often flash Vago gang handsigns. Many members are often heavily tattooed with gang tattoos as part of their unique identity. On the streets, they are either unarmed or carry the 9mm pistol. During a gang war, they carry the Micro SMG, Baseball bat, SMG, AK47, and the 9mm pistol.
					<br/><br/>
					Upon spotting a Balla, Grove, or Azteca on their territory - they will often get into a violent confrontation (especially if Aztecas).
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt5_5">
					<h2>VARRIOS LOS AZTECAS</h2>
					<br/>
					There are three Triad factions in San Fierro consisting of a set hierarchy with small sets answering to larger sets; the Blood Feather Triad, which would later be slaughtered by their rivals, the Da Nang Boys; the Red Gecko Tong, which is led by Ran Fa Li; and the Mountain Cloud Boys (山雲男孩). The most prominent gang in the group, the Mountain Cloud Boys, is operated by the blind Wu Zi Mu and answers to the Red Gecko Tong.
					<br/><br/>
					In addition to their bases of operations in San Fierro, the Triads also own and operate a casino hotel venture called The Four Dragons Casino on the southern tip of The Strip in Las Venturas; ownership is shared between Wu Zi Mu, Ran Fa Li and Carl Johnson. Because of intense Mafia pressure in the city, the Triads attempted to flex their muscles to show the Mafia that they can hold their own casino on The Strip. While the Triad's prime business is gambling, Wu Zi Mu has shown motivations towards robbery and street racing.
					<br/><br/>
					Triad members don all-black suits or all-grey suits. The Triad gang members appear on the streets in Chinatown, the most northern tip of King's and Calton Heights in San Fierro. Strangely, they do not appear on Las Venturas streets, even areas surrounding the Four Dragons Casino, although they can be seen on several cutscenes and missions. They usually wield AK-47s and pistols, however in certain missions they can be seen with different guns.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt5_6">
					<h2>SAN FIERRO TRIADS</h2>
					<br/>
					The Varrios Los Aztecas are an extremely proud Mexican/Latino street gang, and they control El Corona, Little Mexico and Unity Station. They are the smallest gang in the city but are likely to be one of the most heavily armed, giving them power over the other gangs. They are a traditionally anti-narcotic gang like the Grove Street families, with heavy involvement in gun running/arms trafficking, gang-banging, gang warfare, street violence, gang-related homicide, murder, vandalism, and illegal street racing. They are easily identifiable by their turquoise colored bandanas and 90's "cholo" style clothing.<br/>
					On the streets, they are either unarmed or armed with the 9mm Pistol or the Micro SMG. Since they carry the Micro SMG on the streets along with an RPG, Tec-9, and Katana in the mission Los Desperados, they are actually better armed than their primary enemy - the Vagos, though the Vagos are much larger and have more territory while the Aztecas are the smallest gang in Los Santos - suggesting that they are probably on equal power.
					<br/><br/>
					The Aztecas are traditionally heavily into cars and the lowriding culture and "hopping" or hydraulics usage as part of their gangs identity and past-time. They have a betting competition known as the Lowrider Challenge. It can be found at Unity Station after talking to the mechanic just outside of the east wall of the station's parking lot.
					<br/><br/>
					Interestingly, unlike the Ballas and the Grove Families; the Aztecas are not divided into different sets - and are formed as one large gang instead. This is probably due to their small size: the different sets make it easier to organize large gangs, while the Aztecas wouldn't necessarily have that problem.

					<h2>Angels of Death</h2>
					<br/>
					They still maintain their traditional rivalry with the Families. They usually do not attack if the player happens to walk through or pass through their territory. However, if taunted enough times, or if one fires a gun in their territory, or just because of walking near and staring the Ballas will become hostile and begin to shoot or punch the player. Their dogs will also occasionally attack the player, especially if the player is Franklin. The Ballas are supporters of the Los Santos Panic Basketball Team and the Boars Baseball Club, with their purple attire matching the teams' colors.
					<br/><br/>
					They can often be seen drinking, driving cars, bikes, and even walking dogs. Most Ballas stand on the sidewalks in groups of 3-5. Their weapons include pistols and knives. Members are also seen smoking cigarettes, marijuana, and drinking.
					They're brash and love to show off their weaponry, money and guns in social media.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt6_2">
					<h2>Lost in MC</h2>
					<br/>
					The Lost Motorcycle Club is an outlaw motorcycle club operating primarily out of Acter, state of Alderney in 2008, but nationally in 2013.<br/>
					According to The Lost website, The Lost began in 1964 with eight U.S. Marines who met in Hanoi, North Vietnam. After the war ended, they had a continued thirst for drugs and violence. Because of this, they started the club and named it 'The Lost' in honour of all their friends who had been killed in the war.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt6_3">
					<h2>Northwood Dominican Drug Dealers</h2>
					<br/>
					The gang is a part of a drug dealing operation led by Willy Valerio. Valerio's captain's are the Gomez brothers: Alonso and Oscar. The small crew looks more likely to be a Dominican part (or counterpart) of the Puerto Rican Spanish Lords as they usually spawn in the some of the same territories. The gang is also said to be involved in underground streetfighting.
					<br/><br/>
					Members of ND3, wear heavy coats varying in colors black, red, or yellow and wear baseball caps and head bandanas. Unlike the Lost MC, if you shoot a member of ND3 they will shoot back with either 9mms or Uzis. ND3 also use knives during hand-to-hand combat. 
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt6_4">
					<h2>McReary Family</h2>
					<br/>
					The McReary Crime Family is a family of Irish-American criminals based throughout Liberty City, headed by the McReary brothers. They operate in Dukes and formerly the West Side in Purgatory, Algonquin.
					<br/><br/>
					The gang can be seen in Steinway, Dukes, but used to have influence in Purgatory, Algonquin. The members of the gang wear casual clothes, sometimes with green color, and have ginger hair, since the gang is Irish. They drive modified Übermacht Oracles and green Contenders.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt6_5">
					<h2>Uptown Riders</h2>
					<br/>
					The Uptown Riders are a motorcycle gang. Their members include Malc and DeSean and their headquarters are in Northwood, Liberty City. The club rides Japanese and Italian sport bikes and appear to be predominately African-American, much like the Ruff Ryders.
					They are also said to sell merchandise such as clothing, DVDs, video games, books, and motorcycle equipment. You can hear this on the Beat 102.7 or see this on their website.
					<br/><br/>
					Their clubhouse is inaccessible, though you can arm wrestle with members of the Uptown Riders outside the clubhouse, but if you're armed or on a bike, they will attack you (same with the Angels of Death when arm wrestling). If you don't want to be attacked, park your bike somewhere away from their clubhouse.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt6_6">
					<h2>Uptown Riders</h2>
					<br/>
					Russian criminals can be encountered in Hove Beach, Firefly Island and Beachgate, wearing suits, leather jackets, casual clothes and sport attire and driving Rebla, Schafter, Uranus and Ingot.
					Despite this, Russian mobsters won't help Russian gangsters in fight, hinting, that members of the crime syndicates don't tie themselves with street level criminals.
					<br/><br/>
					Gang was founded by Kenny Petrovic, who was born in Russia in 1956. His father was a World War II veteran, who fought during the Battle of Stalingrad. Kenny arrived in the US in the 1980s on an Israeli passport though, this was confiscated when evidence came to light that he did not, as previously claimed, have a Jewish grandmother. Kenny joined Russian Organized Crime and with the permission of the gang's elders started to make money by shipping American-made cars back to Russia. After some time in America, he formed his own organization and became the kingpin of Russian Organized Crime in Liberty City, if not the whole United States.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt6_7">
					<h2>Yardies</h2>
					<br/>
					Yardies seem to be Rastafarians, despite the strong denial of violence and heavy drugs within religion. Little Jacob mentions this differences, judging cocaine trade inside the gang and blaming it for fights between Rastas and changes in Badman's character. Yardies speak iyaric as well as patois, frequently smoke marijuana, and wear their hair in dreadlocks. They can be seen wearing brightly colored suits or army fatigues, and some wear Rasta tams, which is a sign of rudeboys style. Some can even be seen wearing gold African continent pendants. They are well-armed, most members carrying pistols, or occasionally a knife or baseball bat. They drive Voodoos and Huntleys painted in the colors of the Jamaican flag: green, black, and gold. They can mainly be found in the Beechwood City region, particularly the Homebrew Café, and have a smaller presence in neighboring Schottler and Willis as well.

					<h2>Ballas</h2>
					<br/>
					They still maintain their traditional rivalry with the Families. They usually do not attack if the player happens to walk through or pass through their territory. However, if taunted enough times, or if one fires a gun in their territory, or just because of walking near and staring the Ballas will become hostile and begin to shoot or punch the player. Their dogs will also occasionally attack the player, especially if the player is Franklin. The Ballas are supporters of the Los Santos Panic Basketball Team and the Boars Baseball Club, with their purple attire matching the teams' colors.
					<br/><br/>
					The Ballas control almost the entire community of Davis. The cul-de-sac of Grove Street is a particular hot spot for activity as well as Davis Avenue, Brouge Avenue and Covenant Avenue in the neighborhood.
					They can often be seen drinking, driving cars, bikes, and even walking dogs. Most Ballas stand on the sidewalks in groups of 3-5. Their weapons include pistols and knives. Members are also seen smoking cigarettes, marijuana, and drinking Pißwasser.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt7_2">
					<h2>The families</h2>
					<br/>
					The Families have territory in the whole of Chamberlain Hills and Strawberry neighborhoods, and also some parts of Davis. They hold a bitter rivalry with the neighboring Ballas gang and the Los Santos Vagos gang on the southeast side in Rancho. Their signature green attire mainly comes from the support of the colours of the Los Santos Corkers Baseball Team and the Feud Baseball Team. The "Forum Gangsters" may as well support the San Andreas Magnetics as seen by Lamar's general attires, and the Feud Baseball Team as seen by Franklin's purchasable clothing. Also it is clear that the "Davis Neighborhood Families" also support the Dust Devils hockey team due to the members of this set seen wearing Dust Devils attire with their logo.

				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt7_3">
					<h2>Lost MC</h2>
					<br/>
					Sometime after the events of GTA 4, some members of the Liberty chapter moved west towards the rural lands of Blaine County; these members included Johnny Klebitz, Clay Simons, and Terry Thorpe. They managed to establish a club hideout in Stab City, known as The Range. The Lost also own a safehouse/front in Grapeseed along with an airstrip.
					<br/><br/>
					Although The Lost maintain a strong presence in Blaine County, they also happen to be active in the city of Los Santos as well. There aren't as many club members in LS as Blaine County, but they still pose a threat to locals. The Lost are mostly seen around the East Vinewood area, where they patrol in their Gang Burritos and operate a clubhouse.
					The Lost's presence grew throughout the county; however, drug use became an issue within the club.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt7_4">
					<h2>Madrazo cartel</h2>
					<br/>
					Led by Mexican Martin Madrazo and his family, the gang muscle is mainly made up of young Hispanic men of Guatemalan origin[1]. Gang muscle are seen wearing distinctive Flying Bravo polo shirts of varying colors and designs, usually with numbers on the sleeves. Internal character models are named "Pologoon" reflecting their common wardrobe. Higher up members of the gang do not wear these shirts and sometimes use the same models as the Vagos and the Armenian Mob. Like the Aztecas, many of the cartel members re-use the Vagos members dialogue.
					<br/>
					The cartel members at La Fuente Blanca will not be immediately hostile to the player unless the player stays in their vicinity too long. Verbal warnings will be given before any aggressive response is encountered.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt7_5">
					<h2>Motorcycle Club</h2>
					<br/>
					Motorcycle Clubs are a gameplay element in Grand Theft Auto Online introduced in the Bikers Update. It allows players to start Motorcycle Clubs and carry out tasks while hiring other players prospects and promoting their ranks.
					<br/><br/>
					A Motorcycle Club can only have a maximum of 8 members, including the president. Each player that joins to the MC will start as a prospect, this can be altered in the Interaction Menu; each role can start their own challenges and use their own abilities.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt7_6">
					<h2>O'niel Brothers</h2>
					<br/>
					The O'Neil Brothers are a family of inbred, hillbilly, redneck meth dealers in Grapeseed, Blaine County. They are familiar with the Varrios Los Aztecas gang, with The Lost MC and with Trevor Philips, a drug and arms dealer also based in Blaine County with his own company, Trevor Philips Enterprises, whom the O'Neil Brothers are rivals with.
				</div>
				<div class="cont_gt7_7">
					<h2>The Proffesionals</h2>
					<br/>
					As their name implies, they are a professional group of criminals that deal in drug trafficking and arms smuggling. They operate all throughout San Andreas. The Professionals appear in several missions, Gang Attacks and Biker Contracts.
					<br/><br/>
					The Professionals appear to be a drug-distribution network, dealing with various other gangs such as the Ballas, the Vagos, and The Lost MC. The Professionals seem to be affiliated with the Federal Investigation Bureau as well. They are in control of many different fronts, including the Mile High Club construction site, as seen in a Gang Attack.
					<br/><br/>
					The Professionals dress in suits, sports coats, collared fabric bomber jackets or collared leather bomber jackets with business attire, and are multi-racial, with white, black, and Hispanic members. Some wear black leather gloves, adding even more to their look of stereotypical hitmen. Sometimes, they may be seen wearing black, gray or white ballistic face masks, as well as bandana masks and ski masks. The Professionals always drive all-black or all-gray vehicles, ranging from sedans, like the Fugitives to Grangers. In some Online missions, they can be seen using Vapid Speedo's for transporting cargo and sometimes pursue the player on Bati 801's.
					<br/><br/>
					Most likely making use of their military skills, they acquire and make use of Maverick and Buzzard Attack Chopper as seen in numerous contact missions and Gunrunning resupply missions. They also own a Technical Custom which is stolen by the player in a resupply run.
